The above repository shows how to implement the Recurrent Neural Network's forward propagation, back propagation from stratch.
The dinos.txt file contains the names of dinosaurs. This is the training data that the model is trained upon.
The model learns how to generate dinosaur's name given first few characters.
Backpropagation through time is implemented by adding the gradients across all the time steps.
